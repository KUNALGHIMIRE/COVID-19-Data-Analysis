# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data using Python. It explores trends in confirmed, deaths, recovered, and active cases globally and per country. Key metrics like Case Fatality Rate (CFR), Recovery Rate, and Active Case Ratio are calculated, and insights are visualized.

## Project Overview
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, rename columns, and format dates.
- **Global Analysis**: Explore total confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases worldwide.
- **Country-wise Analysis**: Identify top affected countries and compare recovery and fatality rates.
- **Time Series Trends**: Examine COVID-19 trends over time for selected countries.
- **Rate Calculations**:
  - **Case Fatality Rate (CFR)**
  - **Recovery Rate**
  - **Active Case Ratio**
- **Visualizations**: Line charts, bar charts, stacked area charts, and correlation heatmaps for insights.
